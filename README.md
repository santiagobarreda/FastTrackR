An R package that interacts with the data generated by Fast Track, a Praat plugin meant to facilitate automatic formant tracking. It's at a pretty early stage right now, though most functions do work.

Example of a folder analysis using the current functions:

```
### change to working directory
setwd("C:/myworkingdirectory/")

#extract stressed vowels using textgrid.
extractvowels ("filename.TextGrid", "filename.wav", segmenttier=2,wordtier=1,stress = 1)

## this tracks the formants. I specified the boundaries and number of steps
formants = trackformants.folder (from = 5000, to = 7000, nsteps = 20)

## run classic autoselection based on default settings.
selectioninfo = autoselect.classic()

# get the winning analyses. You can give it the formant and selection objects
# ff_data = getwinners(formants = formants, selection_info = selectioninfo)
# or it will assume you want to use the RDS files in the working directory.
ff_data = getwinners()

# aggregate CSV equivalent data
aggregated = aggregatedata (csvs = ff_data)

# really basic plotting functions I made
par (mfrow = c(1,2), mar = c(4,4,1,1))
ft.lines(aggregated, xformant=2,yformant=1, revaxes = TRUE, logaxes=FALSE)
ft.arrows(aggregated, xformant=2,yformant=1, revaxes = TRUE, logaxes=FALSE)
ft.points(aggregated, xformant=2,yformant=1, revaxes = TRUE, logaxes=FALSE)
```
